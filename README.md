## What is Ball Sort Puzzle 2?

Ball Sort Puzzle is an engaging brain teaser that combines color sorting with strategic thinking. In this addictive puzzle game, players must sort colored balls into test tubes using logical reasoning and careful planning. Set against a serene nighttime backdrop, the game offers hundreds of increasingly challenging levels that will test your problem-solving abilities.

Each level presents you with a set of test tubes filled with colored balls in random arrangements. Your goal is to sort them until each tube contains balls of the same color. The catch? You can only move balls to tubes that either have matching colors at the top or are completely empty.
